# 2026-02-20

## Session Notes
- Initialized and reviewed workspace scaffold.
- Added foundational project improvements:
  - `README.md` with architecture and operating guidance.
  - `MEMORY.md` long-term memory seed.
  - `scripts/validate-workspace.ps1` for structural checks.
  - `.gitignore` for common local/runtime artifacts.
- Assessed repository: mostly policy and context files; no application source code yet.

## Follow-ups
- Complete `IDENTITY.md` and `USER.md` with real values.
- Decide whether `BOOTSTRAP.md` should be removed after onboarding completion.
- Optionally define heartbeat tasks in `HEARTBEAT.md`.
